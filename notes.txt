1. Rohith's GitHub username is RS2007. The RS stands for Rohith Suresh and the 2007 stands for the year of birth of the girls he goes for
2. Referencing Guneet's joke in the first AHM, the change in Ishaan through the tenure is that he can now find the G Spot but not the bugs (mf stored Date as number)
3. Timeline in landing page:
    Work
    Work
    Treat

4. We thought the only rizz Rohith could pull was tech support (hackstart photo) until we saw this (singing)
5. To Ishaan - Bandi pat gayi to dost ko bhul gaya? (Find a picture of him batting)
    Ishaan: Nahi
